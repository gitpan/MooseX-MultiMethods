  * Redispatch upwards if possible, instead of quickly resigning to an error
    when no variant was found in a class (Sartak).

  * Depend on MooseX::Types::VariantTable 0.02.
    It sorts Types topologically now. All variants in a single
    slot are tried for a match, and if the result is ambiguous
    an error is thrown. This matches Perl 6's behavior for multi
    method dispatch.

  * Initial release.
